hi folx..

this application does basically the same as vorbiscomment does. but this one has a gui.

one situation where it was superior to vorbiscomment during my fiddlings:

- rip, encode, tag a cd with abcde
- my knowledge about abcde (or perhaps freedb comments files) did not include how to append "DATE" and "GENRE" to the comments
- so afterwards open kvorbiscomment and konqueror with the directory of the encoded files
- enter the DATE and GENRE in the dialog for the "comments file"
- drag an ogg file to kvorbiscomment
- hit "append comments"
- drag the next ogg file to kvorbiscomment and hit yes when asked for saving the old one
- hit "append comments"
- etc.

this post-tagging is quite fast.

since this is my first kde/configure-app to ship, please report any errors or difficulties. i will try to fix it, then. :)

cheers,
 sebastian henschel
